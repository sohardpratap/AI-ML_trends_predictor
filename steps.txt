1. Data Collection
Source: You provided a CSV file containing customer shopping data with 19 columns, including Customer ID, Age, Gender, Item Purchased, Category, etc.
2. Data Loading
File: load_data.py
Action: Loaded the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and displayed an overview of the data.
Outcome: Successfully loaded the data and displayed summary statistics, confirming no missing values or issues in data types.
3. Data Preprocessing
File: preprocess.py
Action: Cleaned the data, handling categorical variables, encoding, and feature scaling.
Outcome: Processed data saved to 'data/processed/processed_data.csv' for use in modeling.
4. Model Setup
File: train_model.py
Action: Used RandomForestClassifier to build a binary classification model predicting whether a customer will make a purchase.
Outcome: Model trained and saved to 'models/random_forest_purchase_model.pkl'.
5. Model Evaluation
File: train_model.py
Action: Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Outcome: Model accuracy: 50%, with the classification report showing balanced performance for both classes.
6. Prediction Setup
File: predict_purchase.py
Action: Implemented code to make predictions using the trained model on new data.
Outcome: Implemented a prediction pipeline, which processes input data and provides purchase predictions.
7. Model and Prediction Testing
Action: Tested the model by running train_model.py and predict_purchase.py to ensure everything worked as expected.
8. Dependencies Setup
Action: Created a requirements.txt file to include necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn).
